    </p>

    <p class="subtitle">Ingredients</p>
    <ul class="content">
      <li>1 pound dry black beans</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>4 ounces slab bacon</li>
      <li>1 pound pork ribs</li>
      <li>
        1 smoked sausage (roughly 7 oz), such as linguica or kielbasa, sliced
      </li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>3 tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 bay leaves</li>
      <li>water</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subtitle">Steps</p>
    <ol class="content">
      <li>In a large bowl with water, soak beans overnight.</li>
      <li>
        When you are ready to make your stew, in a large heavy-bottom soup pot,
        over medium heat, add the oil and bacon. Cook until crisp and transfer
        to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the same saucepan to brown ribs and sausages in batches. (You will
        want to be sure to cook the sliced Mexican chorizo on its own, as it can
        be very greasy. Drain the grease before continuing.) Set each aside as
        cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        If needed, add more oil to the pan. On medium-high, saut√© onion, and
        garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and
        cook for another 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with the
        ribs, bacon, sausages, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Cover with water
        (about 8 cups).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it
        cook for 2 to 2 and a half hours, or until the beans are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the stew is too liquidy, uncover the saucepan and continue to cook
        for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with white rice and sprinkle some farofa on top.</li>
    </ol>
